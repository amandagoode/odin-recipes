            Apple crisp is one of the first recipes I learned to make myself as a child. 
                Sometimes I would triple the topping recipe because everyone in my family loved the buttery, crunchy, brown sugar oats.
                My dad would eat any uncooked topping that wouldn't fit in the pan with a spoon. It's a simple recipe for kids to learn
                if you help them cut the apples, perfect after going apple picking, an annual tradition where I live.
